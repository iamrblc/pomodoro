# 🍅 A CUSTOMIZABLE POMODORO SCHEDULER 🍅
## 🍅 BACKGROUND
As a freelancer, developing good time management practices was crucial for me, especially as someone with ADHD. I needed a routine that allowed me to stay focused as much as possible. One day, after struggling to stay on track, I remembered how *productive* school days used to be with 45-minute lessons devoted to different *projects*... I mean, subjects like math, literature, biology, or even gym class.

So, I decided to create a mock timetable that mimicked a school day, and surprisingly, it worked! I shared this technique with a friend, who told me about the Pomodoro Method, a similar time management technique. I decided to check it out (thanks, Houssem!).

Although the Pomodoro Method worked for me in many instances, I noticed that 5-minute breaks sometimes disrupted my flow, making it hard to get back on track. I wanted a Pomodoro schedule that I could customize to my current mood, but I couldn't find one that was freely customizable or affordable.

## 🍅 WHAT DOES THIS CODE DO?
First it asks you
- when you would like to start your working day? (Default is the time when you run the code.)
- When do you want to have lunch. (Almost always around noon.)
- When do you want to go for a walk with your dog? (Okay, it is crucial for me. 😝)
- How many pomodoros do you want to schedule for that day?
- How long the short and longer recesses last?
- How long should be the "recreational time" - well, lunch break and the afternoon dog walk. Normally these are about an hour.

The defaults are 8 pomodoros a day, with 45-minute lessons (I mean 🍅s), with 10 minute breaks in between. However, every third recess is 15-minute long. At school we called it the *long breaks*. 😂 While it's not too long, it's still enough to load the washing machine, water the plants, play fetch with the dog in the yard or just sit on the balcony with a cup of tea and/or try to meditate. 

## 🍅 HOW DOES IT WORK?
Run the python file from the terminal and it will ask the initial questions. (Yes, you need to have python installed on your computer.) If you don't want to change the default paramters, just hit enter. 

```bash
cd /path_to_the_directory_of_the_pomodoro_file
python pomodoro.py
```
Once you defined the inital paramters you will get the working schedule for the day.

## 🍅 CAN I REUSE THIS CODE?
Sure.
